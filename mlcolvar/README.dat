This folder contains two notebooks: 
(1) preprocessing.ipynb
(2) deeptica.ipynb

(1)     Requires a .trj file and a .pdb file where each peptide is separated by 'TER'. Ouputs a plumed.dat file and subsequently a COLVAR file with CVs of 
        phi/psi angles for each alpha carbon and distances between all alpha carbons. Code works independent of amount of amino acids in peptides, only 
        thing that matters is having 'TER' between peptides in the .pdb file.

(2)     Requires a COLVAR file produced by (1). Ouputs a .ptc version of the ML model, ready to be used in dftb for running biased simulations.
